# RoofMapNet
Our code and data are coming soon!
## Introduction

## Data
We have constructed a dataset named RoofMapSet, specifically designed for extracting building outlines and roof structure information from remote sensing imagery. This dataset carefully selected 9,576 building instances from the [WHU Building Dataset](http://gpcv.whu.edu.cn/data/building_dataset.html) and the [Inria Dataset](https://project.inria.fr/aerialimagelabeling/), covering diverse architectural styles, imaging conditions, and geographic locations. This work aims to advance research on the automatic extraction and reconstruction of roof structures based on remote sensing imagery. Our data can be accessed [here]().
